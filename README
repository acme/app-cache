NAME
    App::Cache - Easy application-level caching

SYNOPSIS
      # in your class:
      my $cache = App::Cache->new({ ttl => 60*60 });
      $cache->delete('test');
      my $data = $cache->get('test');
      my $code = $cache->get_code("code", sub { $self->calculate() });
      my $html = $cache->get_url("http://www.google.com/");
      $cache->set('test', 'one');
      $cache->set('test', { foo => 'bar' });
      my $scratch = $cache->scratch;
      $cache->clear;

DESCRIPTION
    The App::Cache module lets an application cache data locally. There are
    a few times an application would need to cache data: when it is
    retrieving information from the network or when it has to complete a
    large calculation.

    For example, the Parse::BACKPAN::Packages module downloads a file off
    the net and parses it, creating a data structure. Only then can it
    actually provide any useful information for the programmer.
    Parse::BACKPAN::Packages uses App::Cache to cache both the file download
    and data structures, providing much faster use when the data is cached.

    This module stores data in the home directory of the user, in a dot
    directory. For example, the Parse::BACKPAN::Packages cache is actually
    stored underneath "~/.parse_backpan_packages/cache/". This is so that
    permisssions are not a problem - it is a per-user, per-application
    cache.

METHODS
  new
    The constructor creates an App::Cache object. It takes three optional
    parameters:

    *   ttl contains the number of seconds in which a cache entry expires.
        The default is 30 minutes.

          my $cache = App::Cache->new({ ttl => 30*60 });

    *   application sets the application name. If you are calling new() from
        a class, the application is automagically set to the calling class,
        so you should rarely need to pass it in:

          my $cache = App::Cache->new({ application => 'Your::Module' });

    *   directory sets the directory to be used for the cache. Normally this
        is just set for you and will be based on the application name and be
        created in the users home directory. Sometimes for testing, it can
        be useful to set this.

          my $cache = App::Cache->new({ directory => '/tmp/your/cache/dir' });

    *   enabled can be set to 0 for testing, in which case you will always
        get cache misses:

          my $cache = App::Cache->new({ enabled => 0 });

  clear
    Clears the cache:

      $cache->clear;

  delete
    Deletes an entry in the cache:

      $cache->delete('test');

  get
    Gets an entry from the cache. Returns undef if the entry does not exist
    or if it has expired:

      my $data = $cache->get('test');

  get_code
    This is a convenience method. Gets an entry from the cache, but if the
    entry does not exist, set the entry to the value of the code reference
    passed:

      my $code = $cache->get_code("code", sub { $self->calculate() });

  get_url
    This is a convenience method. Gets the content of a URL from the cache,
    but if the entry does not exist, set the entry to the content of the URL
    passed:

      my $html = $cache->get_url("http://www.google.com/");

  scratch
    Returns a directory in the cache that the application may use for
    scratch files:

      my $scratch = $cache->scratch;

  set
    Set an entry in the cache. Note that an entry value may be an arbitrary
    Perl data structure:

      $cache->set('test', 'one');
      $cache->set('test', { foo => 'bar' });

  directory
    Returns the full path to the cache directory. Primarily useful for when
    you are writing tests that use App::Cache and want to clean up after
    yourself. If you are doing that you may want to explicitly set the
    'application' constructor parameter to avoid later cleaning up a cache
    dir that was already in use.

      my $dir = $cache->directory;
